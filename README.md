# YAML Reviews

This is a start on an open source repository to house my reviews of restaurants [away from companies like Yelp](https://medium.com/@taliajane/an-open-letter-to-my-ceo-fb73df021e7a#.yjw3c8onr). The format is still evolving, and will hopefully become more standard as I add more.

We currently have [6 reviews](reviews.yaml), [free to use](LICENSE)!
