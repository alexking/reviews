[{"name":"Thai Fusion Bistro","rating":4,"visits":[{"cost":"$34.91","people":2}],"review":"My favorite thing here is probably the Thai Fusion Pasta, but the Mango Fried rice is also great. Spring rolls are also solid with a great plum dipping sauce. Plus it's right next to a theater, so you can get dinner and walk right over to a movie.\n"},{"name":"Wild Mountain Cafe","rating":5,"visits":[{"cost":"$44.62","people":2}],"review":"Really wonderful spot for brunch - the whole place is a converted house, and filled entirely with recycled furniture, giving it a really nice feeling. But the real high point is the food - the flavors really pop, and there are plenty of veggie options (plus they'll happily modify anything for you). I'd recommend the Eggs Benedict, and the Tower of Power, which takes their delicious fried garlic mashed potato cakes and covers them with sauted veggies and cheese (with optional eggs on top). Don't miss this place!\n"},{"name":"Patty's Eggnest","rating":4,"website":"http://pattyseggnestrestaurant.net","location":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2431805264","review":"This has become one of my favorite weekend breakfast spots. They have a great Veggie Benedict, Smoked Salmon Benedict, and plenty of different omelets and scrambles. My wife tends to get the French Toast or Swedish Pancakes, which both come with a really great Devonshire cream. For sides I’d recommend the O’Brien Potatoes (homefries with peppers and onions), although the hashbrowns are also good.\n"},{"name":"Jay Berry's","rating":3,"website":"http://www.jayberryscafe.com","location":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/116217636","review":"We came here for breakfast, I had The Spinach omelet, which has onion, mushroom, and (of course) spinach, topped with swiss cheese, and then topped with creamy formaggi sauce (which seems to be their replacement for hollandaise - and despite loving hollandaise I don’t mind at all). My wife had The Rooster, which is basically a scrambled egg sandwich, with a cup of formaggi sauce for dipping. They also had biscuits as an option instead of toast (I’m not a huge toast fan).\n"},{"name":"Pop Pop Thai","rating":4,"location":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/220550036","review":"Really great Fried Tofu Pad Thai – and I really appreciate that they offer tofu as a protein on many of their dishes. Their Yellow Curry and Thai Iced Tea are also fantastic.\n"},{"name":"Beijing Chinese Cuisine","rating":4,"website":"http://www.beijingchinesecuisineseattle.com","location":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3594749765","review":"Favorite thing here is the Veggie Chow Mein, really great flavors that remind me a bit of the places I loved on the east coast. Their spring rolls are also quite solid.\n"},{"name":"Pho Tic Tac","rating":3,"location":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/309142818","credit-cards":["accepted",{"minimum":"$10"}],"review":"This place is first and foremost a great deal - they advertise a bowl of Pho for $4.95, but that's a large - you can get a medium (which tends to be enough for me) for $3.95. But despite the low prices, this is great Pho with delicious broth and plenty of basil and sprouts on the side. They also have a wonderful Tofu Pad Thai that my wife swears by.\n"},{"name":"Li'l Woody's Ballard","rating":4,"website":"http://lilwoodys.com","location":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2138399522","review":"Yum - got the Veggie Veggie, which is a black bean based burger, with some pretty standard but very fresh and tasty veggies (tomatoes, onions, iceberg lettuce). My favorite part was house made queso fries - ordering delivery (through Caviar) they gave me a huge tub of cheese sauce that went perfectly with the shoestring fries.\n"}]
